## 3. Design Decisions

> **Q:**  
> Why use DTOs for the Files and Folders in the REST API instead of the already existing Entities?  
> **A:**  
> The Entities used internally have attributes that should not be exposed to the users and systems using the API
> i.e. permissions or accesslogs.  
> Ignoring them via **@JsonIgnore** is not an option as these objects will be parsed back on the consumer side resulting in fields containing null.  
> Removing these attributes from the class and only having an unidirectional connection is not desirable as we would not be able to take advantage of the ORM features like __CascadeType.REMOVE__  
> DTOs make life easier for the consumer as well as for the implementation while only having the overhead of a few more entities and a parser.
